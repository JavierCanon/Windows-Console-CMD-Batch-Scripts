## Philosophy of Javier Cañon

* KISS by design and programming. An acronym for "keep it simple, stupid" or "keep it stupid simple", is a design principle. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward", "keep it small and simple", or "keep it stupid simple".

* Select the best tools for the job, use tools that take less time to finish the job.
* Productivity over complexity and avoid unnecessary complexity for elegant or beauty code.

* Computers are machines, more powerful every year, give them hard work, concentrate on being productive.
